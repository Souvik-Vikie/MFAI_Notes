# Continuity of Function at Zero

**Question: 4**  
Consider \( f(x) = [x^{-1}] \) for \( x \neq 0 \). Here, \([t]\) denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to \( t \). For example, \([2.5] = 2\) and \([-3.5] = -4\). Can you define \( f(0) \) so that \( f \) is continuous at 0?

**Answer:**  
To determine if we can define \( f(0) \) so that \( f(x) \) is continuous at \( x = 0 \), let's analyze the behavior of \( f(x) = [x^{-1}] \) as \( x \) approaches 0 from both sides.

### Step 1: Analyze \( f(x) \) as \( x -> 0 \)
Since \( f(x) = [x^{-1}] \) for \( x \neq 0 \), we need to evaluate the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x-> 0^+ \) and \( x -> 0^- \):

1. **As \( x -> 0^+ \):**  
   When \( x \) approaches 0 from the right (positive side), \( x^{-1} \) becomes very large, tending towards \( +\infty \).
   Therefore, \( [x^{-1}] \) will also tend towards \( +\infty \) as \( x -> 0^+ \).

2. **As \( x -> 0^- \):**  
   When \( x \) approaches 0 from the left (negative side), \( x^{-1} \) becomes very large in magnitude but negative, tending towards \( -\infty \).
   Thus, \( [x^{-1}] \) will tend towards \( -\infty \) as \( x -> 0^- \).

### Step 2: Checking Continuity at \( x = 0 \)
For \( f(x) \) to be continuous at \( x = 0 \), the left-hand and right-hand limits as \( x \to 0 \) would need to be equal and finite. However:

\[
\lim_{x -> 0^+} f(x) = +\infty \quad \text{and} \quad \lim_{x -> 0^-} f(x) = -\infty
\]

Since the limits do not converge to a single finite value, there is no way to define \( f(0) \) such that \( f(x) \) is continuous at \( x = 0 \).

### Conclusion
It is **not possible** to define \( f(0) \) to make \( f(x) \) continuous at \( x = 0 \) because the limits from the left and right of zero diverge in opposite directions.
